                <p>
                  Many refugees are placed in housing in areas where there are
                  few jobs. Bikes provide low-cost transportation so that they
                  can get to work, manage child care and do their shopping.

                  We need lots of bikes and bike accessories! If you have an
                  old bike you don't use, bring it to one of our dropoff
                  events. Or come attend one of our fundraisers.
